----------------------------------
  As Zac Prince, co-founder of BlockFi, tells it his lightbulb moment came at the end of 2016. He entered the cryptocurreny realm in 2014 by 2016 he saw his investments steadily rising. It was at this time he applied for a loan, listing Ethereum and Bitcoin as assets on his application, The bank flagged his application questioning the worth of these asssets. It was then he knew the cryptocurrency asset class would need debt and credit solutions for investors, such as himself. Zac, who came from a background in consumer lending partnered with Flori Marquez. BlockFi officially made its debut 2017. BlockFi was created to provide credit services to markets with limited access to simple financial products. BlockFi sets itself apart from other crypto service providers by pairing competitive rates with institutional-quality benefits. Venture capital backed, BlockFi boasts total equity raised since inception to about $450 million.

  BlockFi has two different kinds of clients accessing loans, retail clients and institutional clients. Retail clients borrow directly through the company's mobile or web app, receiving funds that are secured by the value of their cryptocurrency holdings on BlockFi’s platform. Institutional borrowers, in contrast, can obtain over-collateralized, one-to-one collateralized, or under-collateralized loans.According to co-founder Marquez by the end of 2021 Blockfil will hit one million customers.

  BlockFi has disrupted both the Lending and Wealth management financial industries. Poised to be in league with traditional banks , they've stepped in where some banks have pulled out. After banks pulled out of lending markets following the financial crises, consumers and institutions weren’t able to access debit and credit as they once could. Firms like SoFi and LendingClub filled the void left by banks, and the online lending industry as a whole has been able to capitalize. Fintech is now responsible for 38% of the personal loan market in the US.

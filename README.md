-----
As Zac Prince, co-founder of BlockFi, tells it his lightbulb moment came sometime around the end of 2016. At that time he was fully vested in the world of cryptocurrency. Zac decided to apply for a loan, listing Ethereum and Bitcoin as assets on his application, The bank flagged his application questioning the worth of these asssets. It was then he knew the cryptocurrency asset class would need debt and credit solutions for investors, such as himself. Zac, who came from a background in consumer lending partnered with Flori Marquez. BlockFi officially made its debut 2017.  Venture capital backed, BlockFi boasts total equity raised, since inception,to more than $580 million.

Starting with basic credit services, BlockFi has added crypto borrowing and lending options, a crypto interest account, a trading platform and recently partnered with Visa on a credit card that allows clients to earn rewards in crypto. BlockFi has two different kinds of clients accessing loans, retail clients and institutional clients. Retail clients borrow directly through the company's mobile or web app, receiving funds that are secured by the value of their cryptocurrency holdings on BlockFi’s platform. This allows them to get liquidity with selling their positions. Institutional borrowers, in contrast, can obtain over-collateralized, one-to-one collateralized, or under-collateralized loans.According to co-founder Marquez by the end of 2021 BlockFi will hit one million customers. As Bain Capital Ventures Partner Stefan Cohen said, "“Bitcoin has already eclipsed $1 trillion in market cap and is likely headed higher to fulfill its store of value promise. As wealth accumulates to BTC holders, most will look for ways to earn yield or borrow against their holdings for more traditional asset purchases such as homes, cars and education,” he wrote via email. “BlockFi stands alone as the leader in bringing simple, secure, everyday financial services to cryptocurrency holders.”

BlockFi's blockchain-driven wealth management platform has certainly disrupted both the Lending and Wealth management financial industries. BlockFi uses 19 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. BlockFi is actively using 42 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Font API.Many call it the "Bank of the Futre", poised to be in league with traditional banks, BlockFi found an audience early on with those unhappy with the traditional means by which banks lend and asertain credit worthiness. Banks pulled out of lending markets following the financial crises, consumers and institutions weren’t able to access debit and credit as they once could. Firms like SoFi, Lending Club and BlockFi tapped into that market and have become an ever growing presence. Fintech is now responsible for 38% of the personal loan market in the US. 

While BlockFi's genensis was in borrowing it's evolved it's business model allowing users to deposit assets and earn interest on it -interest paid in a different currency than the cryptoasset, allowing clients to diversify thier portfolios without having to buy or trade additional cryptocurrency. Just recently they launched a partnership with Visa for a credit card allowing customers to earn rewards in crypto. Within 90 days of launching the first credit card to give Bitcoin as a reward to cardholders, credit card spend is currently pacing toward over $2 billion in annualized spending based on growth projections, further proving the appetite for the new credit card crypto rewards category that BlockFi is shaping, as reported in StreetInsder. These are all moves rivaling traditional banks, with many of BlockFi's competitiors expanding their product base.
